## üíª Running Locally

### Using a Local Server (Recommended)

1. **Python**

   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

2. **Node.js**

   ```bash
   # Install http-server globally
   npm install -g http-server

   # Run the server
   http-server
   ```

3. **PHP**
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
